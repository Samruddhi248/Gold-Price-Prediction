# Gold-Price-Prediction
This project mainly focuses on Predicting the gold prices using machine learning techniques and Algorithms. Here, I have used the data comprising gold prices from the year 2008 to 2018. More description about building this project is given below :

Programming Language used : Python

TechTools used : 1. Kaggle (for downloading Dataset) 

                 2. Jupyter Notebook 
                 3. NumPy 
                 4. Pandas 
                 5. Scikit-Learn

Machine Learning Model used : RandomForestRegressor -> As this is the regression problem, RandomForestRegressor suits better over all other models to predict gold prices.
